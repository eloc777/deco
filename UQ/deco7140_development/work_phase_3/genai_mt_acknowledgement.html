                    <h2>How AI Was Used</h2>

                    <p>
                        Throughout my project development, I strategically
                        utilized AI tools across several areas of my work. For
                        the visual design components, I prompted AI for card
                        display CSS on the style guide page, which I later
                        repurposed for displaying colour cards as well. This
                        approach allowed me to maintain consistent styling
                        across similar display elements while saving development
                        time. I also used AI very successfully for button CSS
                        implementation, which produced clean, functional, and
                        visually appealing styling that integrated well with my
                        overall design language.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Form CSS development was another area where AI
                        assistance proved valuable. The structured nature of
                        forms aligned well with AI's ability to generate
                        consistent styling rules. When encountering technical
                        issues, such as bullet points not displaying correctly,
                        I consulted AI which helped diagnose that the problem
                        stemmed from previously implemented CSS rules‚Äîa
                        troubleshooting approach that saved considerable
                        debugging time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For the more conceptual aspects of my project, I
                        employed AI to help draft an ethical response. To ensure
                        the AI had proper context, I uploaded my original
                        analysis along with the feedback I had received and the
                        marking criteria. This comprehensive input allowed the
                        AI to generate relevant and contextually appropriate
                        suggestions. Importantly, I thoroughly reviewed and
                        modified the AI-generated content: updating it to be
                        more appropriate for the assignment requirements,
                        changing to first person perspective to maintain
                        authentic voice, adjusting the CSS for better
                        presentation, and analyzing all suggestions
                        for relevance and accuracy.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How AI Supported Learning</h2>

                    <p>
                        Using AI as a tool enhanced my learning experience
                        rather than replacing my academic effort. The process of
                        formulating specific prompts for CSS development
                        required me to clearly articulate my design
                        requirements, which deepened my understanding of
                        effective design principles and CSS implementation
                        strategies. When creating card displays and button
                        styles, I needed to evaluate the AI-generated code,
                        understand its structure, and make informed decisions
                        about its application in my project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The experience of troubleshooting CSS issues with AI
                        assistance was particularly educational. Rather than
                        simply applying a fix, I gained insights into how CSS
                        rules interact and potentially conflict with one
                        another. This problem-solving process enhanced my
                        technical knowledge and improved my ability to diagnose
                        similar issues independently in the future.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Working with AI on the ethical response component of my
                        project fostered deeper critical thinking. By providing
                        my original analysis and received feedback to the AI,
                        then carefully evaluating its suggestions, I engaged in
                        a reflective process that strengthened my understanding
                        of ethical considerations relevant to my field. The
                        necessary modifications I made to the AI-generated
                        content required thorough engagement with the material
                        and reinforced my ability to articulate complex ethical
                        concepts in my own authentic voice.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Critical Evaluation of AI's Effectiveness</h2>

                    <p>
                        Throughout my project work, I have definitely noticed
                        that AI excels at simple, well-defined tasks but tends
                        to underperform when asked to handle more complex,
                        multi-faceted problems. This pattern was evident across
                        different applications of AI in my project development
                        process. For CSS implementations like card displays,
                        buttons, and forms, the AI performed exceptionally well
                        when provided with specific requirements, producing
                        clean and functional code that required minimal
                        adjustments.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The AI's performance in diagnosing CSS issues also
                        demonstrated its strength in technical troubleshooting
                        within defined parameters. When I encountered problems
                        with bullet point display, the AI effectively identified
                        the conflict with previously implemented CSS rules,
                        providing a targeted solution to a specific problem.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When working on the ethical response component,
                        which involved more nuanced understanding and contextual
                        awareness, the AI's limitations became more apparent.
                        However, it provided useful starting points based on my
                        uploaded materials. This experience
                        confirmed my understanding that AI tools are most
                        effective when used for targeted applications rather
                        than comprehensive solutions to complex problems.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Process and Documentation</h2>

                    <p>
                        Throughout my project development, I maintained detailed
                        notes on my AI usage, documenting specific prompts,
                        contexts, and outcomes. This methodical approach to
                        documentation served multiple purposes. First, it
                        allowed me to track patterns in AI effectiveness across
                        different applications, informing my strategy for future
                        AI utilization. Second, it provided the foundation for
                        this comprehensive acknowledgement, ensuring
                        transparency regarding which components benefited from
                        AI assistance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My documentation process included recording the specific
                        aspects of CSS development where AI was employed, noting
                        the contexts in which I sought AI troubleshooting
                        assistance, and tracking the evolution of AI-generated
                        content through my review and modification process. This
                        thorough approach to documentation not only supports
                        academic integrity but also reflects my commitment to
                        understanding the appropriate role of AI tools in my
                        work.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>

                    <p>
                        Using AI in academic work raises important ethical
                        considerations that I was mindful of throughout this
                        project. Transparency is a key ethical principle I
                        adhered to by maintaining comprehensive documentation of
                        AI usage and providing this detailed acknowledgement.
                        Following appropriate guidelines for GenAI usage, I have
                        properly disclosed all instances where AI was employed
                        in my project development.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I was particularly conscious of maintaining intellectual
                        ownership of my work while leveraging AI capabilities.
                        For technical components like CSS implementation, I
                        ensured that all AI-generated code was reviewed,
                        understood, and integrated thoughtfully rather than
                        applied without critical evaluation. In the case of the
                        ethical response, I was careful to thoroughly review and
                        substantially modify AI-generated content to reflect my
                        own understanding and perspective, maintaining the
                        authenticity of my academic voice.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Throughout the entire process, I maintained a balance
                        between leveraging AI capabilities and preserving my
                        learning objectives. By using AI as a supporting tool
                        rather than a replacement for critical thinking, I
                        ensured that the final submission authentically
                        represented my understanding, skills, and academic
                        growth. This approach allowed me to benefit from AI as a
                        resource while maintaining the integrity of my academic
                        work and maximizing my learning opportunities.
