                        <p>
                            It was during last year's National Reconciliation
                            Week that I stumbled across an online panel hosted
                            by IndigenousX, a platform amplifying First Nations
                            voices. The discussion centered on "Blak Excellence
                            in Corporate Spaces", and for the first time, I saw
                            people who looked like me, shared my heritage, and
                            worked in industries like mine.

                                Voices: The panelists weren't token
                                representatives—they were CEOs, consultants, and
                                advocates. One speaker, a Gomeroi woman leading
                                a sustainability initiative, spoke about weaving
                                cultural values into boardroom strategies. Her
                                story mirrored my own tension between ambition
                                and identity.

                                Shared Language: Hearing terms like "Country",
                                "community obligation", and "intergenerational
                                strength" in a professional context was
                                electric. It wasn't just jargon; it was a
                                framework for success that resonated deeper than
                                any corporate training.

                                Storytelling: The chat function exploded with
                                messages like "Same, sis!" and "This is why we
                                need more mob in these roles." Strangers shared
                                how they incorporated cultural protocols into
                                their workplaces—like starting meetings with
                                Acknowledgments of Country led by local Elders.
                                The solidarity felt like a digital corroboree.

                                Visibility: One panelist wore a shirt with her
                                clan's totem—a brolga—stitched into the design.
                                That small act of pride in a Zoom square hit me
                                harder than any keynote speech. It reminded me
                                that success doesn't require erasing who you
                                are.

                        <p>Aftermath</p>
                        <p>
                            I left the session with a fire to reclaim my
                            narrative. I started weaving subtle cultural markers
                            into my own work—a Didgeridoo-inspired artwork in my
                            LinkedIn banner, referencing Indigenous
                            entrepreneurs in presentations. The experience
                            didn't "solve" my disconnection, but it gave me a
                            blueprint: cultural identity isn't a relic of the
                            past—it's a lens for innovation. That panel didn't
                            just celebrate Blak excellence—it proved that our
                            identity isn't separate from "success." It's the
                            foundation.

                            Engaging with my community online often feels like
                            navigating a maze where cultural protocols clash
                            with digital norms. In one instance, sharing a story
                            about Country on a public platform led to unintended
                            tension—some Elders felt certain details should've
                            been confined to closed, culturally appropriate
                            spaces. This highlighted how online openness can
                            conflict with our responsibility to protect sacred
                            knowledge.

                                English dominates digital platforms, many
                                community members prefer communicating in our
                                traditional languages. I've seen relatives
                                struggle to express complex cultural concepts in
                                English-only forums, leading to
                                misunderstandings or disengagement. Efforts to
                                use Indigenous languages online are hindered by
                                limited keyboard support and translation tools,
                                making it harder to bridge generational divides.

                                access with expensive, unreliable data plans.
                                During a critical community vote, spotty
                                internet prevented some from participating in
                                the online discussion, skewing representation.
                                This mirrors broader issues where infrastructure
                                gaps exclude remote voices from decision-making.

                                relationship disclosure online (breaching
                                kinship laws) caused offline strife,
                                illustrating how digital actions carry
                                real-world cultural consequences. Elders'
                                limited presence on these platforms further
                                complicates conflict resolution.

                                creates dependency on intermediaries, risking
                                privacy and autonomy.

                                communities often lack reliable internet or

                                not all platforms have robust protocols.

                                This platform wouldn't just look like us—it
                                would feel like us. It's modern enough to be
                                practical (no confusing menus) but rooted in our
                                ways of sharing: oral storytelling, visual art,
                                and deep respect for Country. Most importantly,
                                it would center our voices without forcing us to
                                conform to Western digital norms. For a young
                                mum like me, it would be a bridge—between
                                generations, between tech and tradition, and
                                between our small town and the wider world.

                                Trust is built when platforms reflect Indigenous
                                values: collaboration over competition, respect
                                for intergenerational knowledge, and
                                self-determination. By addressing safety,
                                accessibility, and cultural authenticity, the
                                platform becomes a tool for empowerment—not just
                                a website, but a digital extension of community
                                kinship.
