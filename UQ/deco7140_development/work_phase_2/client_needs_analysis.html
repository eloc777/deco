                <p>
                    We are a non-profit organisation dedicated to fostering
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 1">
                        social cohesion
                    </span>
                    by empowering diverse communities to share their stories,
                    connect with others, and access resources that enhance their
                    visibility and influence. Our mission is to strengthen
                    societal bonds by creating platforms that
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 2"
                        >celebrate and support the unique identities</span
                    >
                    of communities across Australia.

                    This brief has been prepared for the internal design teams
                    at Connect Communities Initiative (CCI). Each design team is
                    tasked with developing individual concepts and prototypes
                    for dynamic websites that align with CCIâ€™s mission and
                    vision.
                </p>
                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    We are commissioning the development of dynamic,
                    user-friendly websites that represent and support different
                    communities. Each website should serve as a central hub
                    where community members can share resources, highlight
                    events, and foster meaningful connections. The websites must
                    not include any form of commercial activity, such as
                    advertising or selling products. However, it is acceptable
                    to promote resources, events, or services that are directly
                    beneficial to the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The websites must be accessible, mobile-friendly, and
                    reflect the diverse needs of the selected community focus
                    area while adhering to our mission of
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 3"
                        >inclusivity,</span
                    >accessibility, and ethical design. Each website should also
                    celebrate the
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 4"
                        >characteristics</span
                    >
                    of its chosen community and support meaningful interaction
                    and engagement.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>
                <p>Each website must serve two key groups:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Community Members: Individuals within the selected
                        community who seek representation, resources, and
                        connection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        General Audience: Broader society, who can use the
                        website to learn about the community and its
                        contributions.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Accessibility must be prioritised to ensure seamless
                    interaction for all users, including those relying on
                    assistive technologies.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Project Goals</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Represent and celebrate the identity of the chosen
                        community, recognising and representing the diversity
                        within the community rather than relying on stereotypes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide clear, accessible information and resources to

                    <li>
                        Foster meaningful connections and support within the
                        community.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure ethical, inclusive, and culturally sensitive
