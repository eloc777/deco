                <h2>How AI Was Used</h2>

                <p>
                    I employed AI assistance in four key areas of my assignment.
                    First, I used AI to help formulate interview questions based
                    on specific characteristics I provided. This approach
                    allowed me to generate well-structured questions, able to
                    extract the desired information. Second, I utilized AI for
                    simulating interviews by providing detailed descriptions of
                    individuals to represent. This produced comprehensive
                    responses that, while occasionally more detailed than
                    realistic interviews might yield, offered valuable insights
                    for the project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the technical aspects of my assignment, I used AI to
                    create CSS helper classes based on specific criteria
                    required, which proved effective for my needs. Additionally,
                    I used AI to convert my interview content into properly
                    formatted HTML, rapidly reducing the time spent doing
                    mindless tasks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, I engaged AI to brainstorm potential ethical risks
                    associated with incorporating a newsletter on a webpage.
                    Importantly, I critically reflected on each AI-generated
                    suggestion and modified them to align with my personal
                    perspective and understanding of the ethical considerations
                    involved.
                </p>

                <h2>How AI Supported Learning</h2>

                <p>
                    Using AI as a tool enhanced my learning experience rather
                    than replacing my academic effort. When generating interview
                    questions, I was able to focus on defining precise
                    characteristics and requirements, which deepened my
                    understanding of effective questioning techniques in
                    research contexts. The process of providing detailed
                    descriptions for simulated interviews required me to
                    carefully consider the personas I wanted to represent,
                    strengthening my understanding of user perspectives and
                    interview dynamics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Working with AI to create CSS helper classes improved my
                    technical knowledge as I needed to define specific criteria.
                    This process of providing requirements, reviewing AI output,
                    and refining my approach enhanced my capacity to think about
                    web design without getting held down by minor details.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Also useful to my learning was the ethical brainstorming
                    process. By having AI generate potential ethical concerns
                    and then critically evaluating each one, I was able to
                    consider ethical risks which were not immdediately obvious
                    to me. The process of adjusting AI suggestions to reflect my
                    own viewpoint required deep engagement with the material and
                    strengthened my critical thinking abilities.
                </p>

                <h2>Critical Evaluation of AI's Effectiveness</h2>

                <p>
                    While AI proved to be a valuable tool throughout my
                    assignment, its effectiveness varied across different
                    applications. For interview question formulation, the AI
                    performed exceptionally well when provided with specific
                    characteristics, producing focused and relevant questions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The simulated interviews using AI highlighted both strengths
                    and limitations of the technology. The AI produced
                    comprehensive responses that provided ample data for
                    analysis. However, I observed that these responses were
                    sometimes overly detailed and structured compared to
                    authentic human interviews, which tend to include more
                    natural variation, ambiguity and worse grammar. This
                    limitation required me to adjust my analysis to account for
                    this artificial consistency.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For CSS helper classes, AI proved highly effective when
                    given specific criteria. The technical nature of this task
                    aligned well with AI's strengths in code generation.
                    Similarly, converting interview content to HTML was
                    efficiently handled by AI, though I needed re-prompt due to
                    my initial prompt not being specific enough.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The brainstorming of ethical risks demonstrated both the
                    breadth and limitations of AI in conceptual thinking. While
                    the AI provided a range of potential concerns, some lacked
                    contextual relevance or failed to consider the specific
                    context of my project. This required thorough engagement on
                    my part to transform these ideas into meaningful ethical
                    considerations.
                </p>

                <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>

                <p>
                    Using AI in academic work raises important ethical
                    considerations that I was able to navigate throughout this
                    assignment. First, I was mindful of the potential for AI to
                    introduce bias in interview questions and simulated
                    responses. To address this, I reviewed all AI-generated
                    content critically and made adjustments to ensure fair
                    representation and balanced perspectives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Transparency is another key ethical consideration. Following
                    the GenAI & MT Usage Framework guidelines, I have properly
                    acknowledged all instances where AI was used in this
                    assignment, ensuring academic integrity and honesty about
                    the collaborative nature of the work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I also considered the ethical implications of using
                    AI-simulated interviews rather than conducting real
                    interviews. While this approach offered practical benefits,
                    such as huge time savings whilst still facilitaing learning,
                    I recognized the importance of acknowledging the limitations
                    of simulated data and that it is no substitute for real
                    world data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When using AI for ethical brainstorming, I was careful to
                    avoid over-reliance on the technology's perspectives. By
                    critically examining each suggestion and completely
                    reformulating ideas to reflect my own understanding, I
                    maintained intellectual ownership of the ethical analysis
                    while benefiting from AI as a thought-provoking tool.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout the entire process, I maintained a balance
                    between leveraging AI capabilities and preserving my
                    learning objectives. By using AI as a supporting tool rather
                    than a replacement for critical thinking, I ensured that the
                    final submission authentically represented my understanding,
                    skills, and academic growth.
